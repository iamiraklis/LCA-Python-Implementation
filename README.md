# LCA-Python-Implementation
First code in Python

After I was done coding I indented my code and I didn't realize that broke the file until i ran it again.
That's why I edited it. The code is still the same but the updated version has the indentation fixed.

*UPDATE*

DAG implemenatation has been merged with master
